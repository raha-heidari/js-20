/*
   what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer

// The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include: Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server. Sync is blocking â€” it will only send the server one request at a time and wait for that request to be answered by the server.
